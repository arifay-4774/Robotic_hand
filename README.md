Implemented real-time hand landmark detection using OpenCV and MediaPipe, including custom logic to accurately determine finger up/down states.
Achieved real-time ASL gesture detection with low latency.
Eliminated the need for wearable sensors or gloves, reducing hardware cost.
Built a vision-based hand tracking pipeline using OpenCV and MediaPipe to capture and process real-time hand movements from a laptop camera.
